                    <h1>The Story</h1>
                    <p id="tldr">If the glorious tales of sword wielding Viking battling gigantic dragons in hope of treasures, renown and fresh mead, does not sounds like something you would want to waste your time on, you can safely skip to <a href="#rules">the next section.</a></p>
                    <p>
                        The year is 875 after the birth of the Saxons' god. In less than five years time, the Danes have plundered their way through most of England, but are being hold back at Wessex's doors, the richest of all the kingdoms, by the armies of King Alfred "the great". Any viking worth his salt and with a wish to make a name for himself is fighting in the south, while in the rest of England entire danish families are brought from over the seas to settle in and make profit from the land.</p>
                    <p>One dark evening, while gathering firewood in the forest a young girl, named Freya, makes the strangest of encounter. A little further away from where she stood, a soldier was wandering aimlessly sometimes knocking his head against a tree, falling to his knees, getting back up and shuffling forward again. At first she thought he was nothing more than a guard back from the town's tavern, but on closer inspection the warrior seemed to be made of bones only, no skin could be seen on his face or even under his armor. Horrified, Freya ran back to her parents, abandoning all her firewood on the spot (and that's a damn waste). Later that night, Freya's gruesome encounter was reported to the chieftain and word spread across the country of skeleton soldiers walking the land.</p>
                    <p>As time passed on, more and more sightings were reported, but with all this invasion stuff going on in Wessex the viking leaders (also called Jarls) were none too pleased to have to leave their best warriors behind. It was then decided that each clan should send forth one warrior of their choosing to rid the countryside of any sword wielding skeleton. Hence began the unsung tales of our four heroes (more like expendable pawns if you ask me), Ivar "the boneless", Ubba "the fearless", Guthrum "the unlucky" and Halfdan "the cruel", sent out on a quest that amounted to little more than "very old" trash disposal, but that would later be known as the Epic of Viking Doom. Most would say that the rest is history and that you should not worry yourself too much with the past, even more so with that kind of past.</p>
                    <p>But the legends tell us otherwise, our disposable warriors traveled the earth far and wide, spending days after days, months after months killing undead soldiers again, only able to rest to regain some of their lost health and upgrade their equipment. After years of walking (vikings do not like riding horses, like ... not at all), they finally arrived at the entrance of a giant cave. Inside, they discovered the most amazing of all the treasures, but one fiery encounter later they realized that it was closely guarded by a dragon as huge as Jörmungandr, its body covered in scales tough as iron and tainted with a red brighter than  Loki's fire. With all those riches in sight and in hope of making a name for themselves as well (could not do that in Wessex like anyone else now could they?), but most of all to give some meaning to their unending quest, they fought harder than ever before and vanquished the dragon. And that, my dear friends, is how ...</p>
                    <p>"Wait a minute here! That is not how it ends at all." I hear you say, well are not you so smart? Do you think you have what it takes to achieve everlasting glory? Very well then the place is yours, you tell the story.</p>
                    <p><span id="welcom">Welcome to the world of Viking Doom !!!</span> Will you be able to fight your way through hordes of skeletons and orcs to finally get a chance at this dragon slaying business? A world of wisdom to guide you in your task: Henceforth tread carefully and keep your sword tightly gripped in your hands lest you end up in Hel's cold embrace for all eternity (well not forever, but at least until the Ragnarök, you know ... end of the world and all that).</p>

                <section id="rules">
                    <h1>The Rules</h1>
                    <h2>The competition</h2>
                    <p>No limit is placed on the number of games a player can take part in. A player's overall rank on the leader board is determined by the average gold gathered throughout the games he played. The result will be rounded down to avoid floating point ranks.<br/>There is no order for adding players to a game. Whenever a player sends a request, he will be added to the next game regardless of his rank or the number of games already played.<br/>In this brawl, strategy within a game and playing as many of them as possible, will lead you to the top.</p>
                    <h2>The Game:</h2>
                    <p>A game is characterized by a set of four players, each controlling their hero, a map, a start and an end.<br/>At the start of the game, the number of played turn is set to 0, the map is populated with walls, markets, mines, enemies and items and the heros will spawn at their initial position.<br/>From this point on, players can send their actions to move their hero around and complete the quest (i.e.: slain the dragon, get the treasure, go back home, drink, eat and ... well you know ... feast until the Ragnarök).<br/>The game ends when the maximum number of 1000 turns is reached or all players are terminated. The player having amassed the most gold is declared the winner.</p>
                    <h3>Turn:</h3>
                    <p>Because players can send move request asynchronously to the Dungeon Master, in the rest of the rules and part of the <a href="{% url 'docs' %}">technical documentation</a>, the concept of turn will be taking two different meanings:</p>
                    <ul>
                       <li>For a player a turn begins when the Dungeon Master receives a request to move the hero in one direction or the other and ends when an action has been performed, be it moving, shopping or fighting.</li>
                       <li>In the case of the game itself, one turn will be executed every second, from the start of the game until 1000 turns have been completed or all players have been terminated. Each turn, the game will randomly move every skeleton units present on the map, as well as every upgrade caravans. It will then proceed to spawn new items at random locations if any items have been collected by a player in between turns.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As mentioned briefly above, sending move requests is asynchronous, players do not wait on each others (in a brawl you would not wait for someone to punch you back before going on either). You can send as many requests as you want, as fast as you can. The Dungeon Master will consider move requests on a first arrived, first served basis. Thus, your hero should not only be good a collecting gold, but he has to be mighty fast as well. Else you will just lag behind.<br/>
                       Since players can move their hero around anytime they want, it also means that a lot of dying will happen in between requests. If your hero happens to die between two requests, the Dungeon Master will automatically respawn your hero in its initial position and refill its health. However, because it is impossible for the Dungeon Master to correctly notify you of your hero's death, your hero will be tagged as Dead. Upon receiving your next request, the Dungeon Master will ignore any action and will take this opportunity to notify you of your hero's demise. This is done so that you may reconsider your next action in view of your hero's new situation. Once you have been notified, your hero's state will be switched back to Playing and subsequent requests will be treated normally.<br/>
                       A player who has not sent anything to the server for more than 30 seconds, will be considered lost to the world and tagged as Terminated. A terminated player has by no means lost the game. He cannot move around anymore, but the gold gathered so far still remains and the same goes for his ownership over the mines. Thus, a very efficient player even if terminated before the game's end might still end up the winner.</p>
                    <h3>Order of action:</h3>
                    <p>For each player's turn, a hero can do more than simply move around (else it would not be much of a quest). The order in which the Dungeon Master considers what action your hero will really perform next, is as follow:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Items around the hero are collected automatically, but do not count as an action.</li>
                        <li>At first the player's request to move the hero in one of the four possible directions will be considered. The hero moves and the turn ends. That is unless you asked for your hero to remain <var>Idle</var> in which case the Dungeon Master will check for further possible actions to perform. Simply put <var>Idle</var> is not an action.</li>
                        <li>If the hero has not moved, is near a market, has enough gold and is in dire need of the advertised wares, a purchase will be made, ending the turn.</li>
                        <li>If no purchase is made and the hero is near a mine that he does not own, the hero will fight against the Orc guardian, thus ending the turn.</li>
                        <li>If no actions have been performed so far and an enemy (skeleton or dragon) is nearby, the hero will battle with the enemy and end the turn.</li>
                        <li>The same is true if another hero is found in the vicinity of the player (viking clans do not really like each others). Some bludgeoning happens and the turn ends.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Notice: If you happen to ask for an invalid action to be performed, it will be ignored. But since the Dungeon Master is a nice guy he will still check in the same order if your hero fulfills the conditions for performing any other possible actions (stuff buying, mine conquering, enemies and other heroes terrorizing). If nothing can be done, the turn simply ends with everybody left unsatisfied.</p>
                    <h2>The environment</h2>
                    <p>The map our heroes will be traveling, also referred to as the board of the game, is a square of 18 tiles in width and 18 tiles in height. Each tile can contain one of the following object at one time: an enemy, a hero, a mine, an item, a market and a wall, or be left empty.<br/>Enemies and heroes cannot walk on tiles occupied by another object. A request sent by the player to move his hero on a non-empty tile will be considered as a forbidden move.</p>
                    <h2>Hero</h2>
                    <div class="imgs_right">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/hero.png' %}" title="Brown Hero"/>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Health:</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of each game and upon respawning (see <a href="#death">Death</a> below), your hero is granted a level of health of 100 units. This level will surely decrease during your journey to the dragon lair. Fortunately, potions can be found scattered around the map or can even be bought at your local market, that will somewhat restore part of your life force.</p>
                    <h3>Strength and upgrade:</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of the game your hero is weak and inexperienced (told you he was an expendable pawn) and has a basic strength  level of 1. Buying upgrades from merchants at the caravan will increase your strength by 5 units for the low price of 10 golds. A cheaper way to grow stronger is to fight (obviously) or rather to kill enemies. For each enemy killed you will gain 1 level of strength. To avoid your hero turning berserker and power drunk, his strength cannot increase over the level 25.</p>
                    <h3>Battle:</h3>
                    <p>While standing near a mine, an enemy or another hero, your hero will automatically fight. The damage dealt to others is equal to your hero's strength. So the stronger your hero is, the less turn you waste bashing other people's skulls in. Since the request to move your hero is considered before any fighting can happen, this means that running away is a possible alternative to end a fight, but I would not recommend it. No self respecting viking warrior would ever do that. The sheer idea of it makes even the gods tremble.</p>
                    <h3 id="death">Death:</h3>
                    <p>If an enemy or another hero manages to defeat you in battle (decrease your health to 0), your hero will respawn in his initial position. You keep all the gold you gathered so far, but loses ownership over all your mines and live in the shame of having been beaten literally to death and not being called upon by the Valkyries (damn you Odin !!!).</p>
                    <h2>Enemies</h2>
                    <p>Enemies, especially skeletons, are the main reason you began your quest, but with time you will discover that enemies are more a nuisance than anything else, even though they might sometimes even help you protect your hard won gold.</p>
                    <h3>Skeleton:</h3>
                    <div class="imgs_right">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/skeleton.png' %}" title="Skeleton warrior"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Skeletons are the most basic enemy units. Their strength are of the lowest level (level 1, like your hero at the beginning ... Damn that's low) and have been granted 50 units of life. Their souls having left their bodies, they wander the earth randomly walking around until someone put them out of their misery or until the Ragnarök (your pick).<br/>When a skeleton's health level reaches 0 it will die again and disappear from the map. But fear not for you shall not be left without skulls to crush on your way to the dragon. After dying, a skeleton will be replaced by another one which will spawn/appear at a random location on the map.</p>
                    <h3>Orc:</h3>
                    <div class="imgs_right">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/orc.png' %}" title="Orc guardian"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Orcs are creatures born from the ground and that is were you found them, guarding the mines. They have a strength of level 5 and 50 units of health. On the contrary to skeletons, orcs cannot move around and are tied to a mine. Your hero will automatically fight any orc guarding a mine that does not belong to him. If your hero manages to kill the orc, the mine is yours and gold extracted from it will be yours as well. The defeated orc will be brought back to life and resume his role as guardian of your recently acquired mine.</p>
                    <h3>The dragon:</h3>
                    <div class="imgs_right">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/dragon.png' %}" title="The Dragon, the one and only."/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Ah! Now we are talking. Dragons are worthy enemies for the mighty vikings. But they are not so easy to defeat. With a strength level of 25 and 10000 units of life, it will take you some time to kill that beast. Should your hero successfully slain the dragon, he will be rewarded with 500 golds, the songs of hundreds of poets and ever lasting glory.<br/>If the dragon is your main target, you will have to be quick for there is only one dragon per game and it is not coming back to life anytime soon.</p>
                    <h2>Items</h2>
                    <div class="imgs_left">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/potion.png' %}" title="Potion item"/>
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/gold.png' %}" title="Purse item"/>
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/big_gold.png' %}" title="Chest item"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Since heroes cannot step onto tiles containing items, items will be collected by walking on one of the four surrounding tiles (diagonal tiles are out of reach).<br/>In a sense items are attracted to the hero.</p>
                    <h2>Markets</h2>
                    <p>Markets are ideal places to refill your health and grow stronger in no time at all, if you have enough gold in your purse that is.</p>
                    <h3>Potion:</h3>
                    <div class="imgs_right">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/potion_m.png' %}" title="Potion market"/><br/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Potion stores are randomly placed at the beginning of the game and stay in the same location at all time. For the low price of 10 golds, your hero will automatically get 10 units of life back.<br/>Do not worry yourself about decreasing stocks, potion stores have an endless supply and will never disappear.<br/>On each map you will find between 2 and 4 potion stores.</p>
                    <h3>Upgrade:</h3>
                    <div class="imgs_right">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/upgrade_m.png' %}" title="Upgrade market"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>The upgrade caravan is where you will want to go if you are a lazy hero and do not wish to go through the whole kill enemy - gain strength process and skip right to the last step (that would be gain strength). For 10 golds your hero will get stronger by 5 levels.<br/>Beware though, for upgrade caravans will move randomly each turn.<br/>On each map only 1 or 2 upgrade caravans will be traveling, selling their wares.</p>
                    <h2>Mines</h2>
                    <div class="imgs_right">
                        <img src="{% static 'game/images/site/mine.png' %}" title="Mine"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Between 5 and 10 mines are placed randomly on the map at the beginning of the game. They do not have any owner apart from the orc guarding it.<br/>By killing the orc, your hero becomes the owner of the mine. At the beginning of each turn, the riches extracted from the mine your hero owns will be added to his gold. The rate at which gold is mined amounts to 5 units per mine per turn.<br/>If another hero manages to defeat the guardian of one of your mines, the corresponding mine will switch owner and you will not receive any more gold from this mine.</p>
